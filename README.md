========

This WMS 3.X module embeds inline XSL stylesheet within LoadBalancer's
`serverInfoXML` output.

That means you can still parse the XML as usual (no changes in your tools
necessary) and if you display the URL in your browser you get a nice table
instead of raw XML. And it will auto-refresh every 20 seconds.



(And if you want to know more, you better read readme-prettylb.txt.
Because Markdown sucks.)
